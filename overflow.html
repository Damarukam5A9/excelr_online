            ChatGPT is a large language model chatbot, developed by OpenAI, that uses natural language processing to engage in human-like conversations and generate text, answering questions, writing different content types, and more. 
            It uses a "Generative Pre-trained Transformer" (GPT) architecture, a type of neural network trained on a massive amount of text data. 
            This training allows it to understand and generate human-like text, including answering questions, writing articles, composing code, and engaging in conversations. 
            Users interact with ChatGPT by typing in prompts or questions, and it then generates a response based on its training and understanding of the input. 
            Capabilities:
            Question Answering: ChatGPT can answer questions on a wide range of topics. 
            Content Generation: It can generate different types of written content, such as articles, social media posts, essays, emails, and code. 
            Conversational AI: It can engage in human-like conversations, making it useful for customer service, virtual assistants, and other applications. 
            Limitations:
            ChatGPT is not connected to the internet, and it can occasionally produce incorrect answers. 
            It has limited knowledge of world events after 2021. 
            It can also produce harmful instructions or biased content, so it's important to check the accuracy of its responses.
